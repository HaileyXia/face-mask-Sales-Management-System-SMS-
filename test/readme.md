#### Instruction on how to open my website

1. please download all my files in moodle
2. I have put all the data in my database, you do not need to load again.
3. Move the file src into public_html 
4. move the file published into public_html (acutually I have moved them both into public_html already, so you can start with step 5)
5. goto http://cslinux.nottingham.edu.cn/~scytx1/src/index.html  (wait for the background img load)
6. you can see my home page directly
7. if you want to use other function in the website, just check walk through part in my Reference.pdf for more details.

#### How to test my system

1. You need to follow the walk through part in my Reference.pdf to check how to fill in each blank, use the data I show in the TestData.pdf to check the valid and invalid value and fill in the blank. I divide the each html test data into different part. 
2. I have put correct data in the Reference.pdf as well, all the invalid and valid data are in the  TestData.pdf 
3. I have put the expected outcome in my  TestData.pdf
4. just use readme.md,  TestData.pdf, FlowChart.pdf and Reference.pdf to check for more details:)
